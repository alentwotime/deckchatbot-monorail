## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deckchatbot-monorepo.git
cd deckchatbot-monorepo

# create a .env with your keys
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key" > .env
echo "DEBUG=true" >> .env
```

### 2. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend-ai
# (Activate your environment or install requirements)
poetry install
poetry run uvicorn API.api:app --reload
```

### 3. Launch the Frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000/deck-viewer.html` in your browser to try the new 3D deck viewer built with Babylon.js. Use the toolbar to render a deck and export blueprint screenshots or a GLB model.

## üß† AI Integration

We use [Ollama](https://ollama.com/library/llava-llama3) to run LLaVA-Llama3 locally.

```bash
ollama run llava-llama3
```

- HuggingFace support through `xtuner` (model loaders / pipelines)
